A [cali cat](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1545913) is included with the kit in case you want to

## Build Guide

Before assembling the Wedge Case you need to have completed the [Torn PCBs](../../doc/build.md). Complete
the following steps for the left and right sides of your keyboard.

### Step 1

The assembled Wedge weights about 500g. If you want to add some weight for a quality feel and to
make sure it won't more around your desk you can add some extra weight at the bottom of the case.

## Step 2

Press the insert firmly into the base. This is designed to be a tight fit, and it is important that
the insert is correctly seated.

Be careful if you need to remove the insert; you can use a small screwdriver to pry the insert up
by the connector gap.

## Step 5

Add the rest of the MX switch. Be careful not to bend the switch pins.

If you are not using Kailh sockets, you need to solder the switches to the PCB. You might want to
test all the switches are working before proceeding.
