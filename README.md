Torn
===============

![torn](./doc/img/torn.jpg)

The split keyboard kit made by through hole components only.

The design has been inspired by the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), [Plaid](https://github.com/hsgw/plaid) and [Discipline](https://github.com/coseyfannitutti/discipline) keyboards.

It uses an Atmega328P with VUSB:
- [QMK firmware](https://github.com/rtitmuss/qmk_firmware/tree/torn).
- [Bootloader](https://github.com/hsgw/USBaspLoader/tree/plaid) (the same bootloader as the Plaid).

The firmware will be compatible with [VIA](https://caniusevia.com/).

***The next version of the PCB will not be comptatible, with both mechanical and electrical changes. This version is not supported. It is not recommended to use this version!***
